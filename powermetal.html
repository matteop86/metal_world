    <h1> _ POWER METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context.<br>
        Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent, for example, in extreme metal.<br>
        Power metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower.<br>
        Fast and technically demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed.<br><br>

        Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally "powerful" sound.<br>
        Themes that frequently feature throughout other metal subgenres, such as religion and politics, are comparatively rare in power metal - albeit not unheard of.<br>
        Power metal's lyrical themes often focus on fantasy and mythology, camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the aforementioned.<br>
        For example, Finnish band Sonata Arctica have been known for focusing their lyrics of their songs on fantasy but also have many songs based on reality, love and relationships.<br>
        Many power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics. Some have even written their own imaginary stories but also did<br>
        focus on historical wars, battles, and individuals that received notable recognition for their wartime.<br>

        The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America<br>
        with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece, Spain, and Italy),<br>
        South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and East Asia with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.<br>
        Over the late 90s and early 00s, power metal spread over Europe especially as well as the rest of the world, often incorporating new influences.<br>
        European style power metal became widespread in comparison with US style as of the mid 1990s, with numerous North American bands such as Theocracy,<br>
        Borealis, Forgotten Tales, Avian, Pharaoh, Circle II Circle, and Kamelot demonstrating the style.<br>
        This European style of power metal is sometimes considered the "second wave" of power metal since its spread was in the late 1980s and especially<br>
        the mid-late 1990s rather than proliferating throughout the 1980s, and the widespread influence and development of the genre that came<br>
        in its tow while US "first wave" style markedly declined.<br><br>
