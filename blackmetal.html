    <h1> _ BLACK METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2> Black metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style,<br>
    heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere.<br>
    Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. Initially a synonym for "Satanic metal", black metal has often sparked controversy,<br>
    due to the actions and ideologies associated with the genre. Many artists express extreme anti-Christian and misanthropic views, advocating various forms of Satanism or ethnic paganism.<br>
    The genre began in the early/mid-1980s as an offshoot of the popular Heavy Metal style emerging in Britain during this time,<br>
    with bands (most notably, Venom with their extremely important Black Metal album in 1982, which most people consider the beginning of the term itself)<br>
    from this area utilizing powerful occult imagery and a rawer, more stripped-down sound than was usual for typical bands of the times, but other factions<br>
    of influential bands occurred sporadically in other countries in Europe.<br>
    Modern Black Metal has diverged quite a bit from its original path. The genre is very much a worldwide phenomenon currently,<br>
    with prominent acts located in Germany, France, Poland, Russia and even the United States.<br><br>

    Bands: Immortal, Burzum, Venom, Gorgoroth, Mayhem, Emperor.</h2><br>
