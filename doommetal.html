    <h1> _ DOOM METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Doom metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much "thicker" or "heavier" sound than other heavy metal genres.<br>
        Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom.<br>
        The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal. During the first half of the 1980s,<br>
        a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, The Obsessed, Trouble, and Cirith Ungol)<br>
        and Sweden (Candlemass, and later, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.<br><br>

        Doom metal is rooted in the music of early Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath's music is (in and of) itself stylistically rooted in blues,<br>
        but with the deliberately doomy and loud guitar playing of Tony Iommi, and the then-uncommon dark and pessimistic lyrics and atmosphere,<br>
        they set the standards of early heavy metal and inspired various doom metal bands. In the early 1970s both Black Sabbath and Pentagram (also as side band "Bedemon")<br>
        composed and performed this heavy and dark music, which would in the 1980s begin to be known and referred to as doom metal by subsequent musicians, critics and fans.<br><br>

        During the early-mid-1980s, bands from England and the United States[6] contributed much to the formation of doom metal as a distinct genre.<br>
        In 1982, English pioneers Witchfinder General released their debut album Death Penalty. During 1984, two American pioneers also released their debuts;<br>
        Saint Vitus released their eponymous album and Trouble released Psalm 9. That same year American band Cirith Ungol (formed in 1971) released their second studio album,<br>
        King of the Deadâ€”regarded by many as an early influence on doom. Some doom metal bands were also influenced by the underground gothic rock and post-punk scene of the 1980s,<br>
        showing similarities with the dark themes addressed through lyrics and the music atmosphere, both music styles deal with.<br><br>
        
    Bands: Black Sabbath, Type O Negative, Candlemass, Trouble, My Dying Bride, Skepticism. </h2><br>
