    <h1> _ SYMPHONIC METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Symphonic metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that combines the heavy drums and guitars of metal with different elements of orchestral classical music,<br>
        such as symphonic instruments, choirs and sometimes a full orchestra, or just keyboard orchestration.<br>
        Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal,<br>
        and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal.<br>
        Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Dutch bands Epica and Within Temptation, Finnish band Nightwish, and Swedish band Therion.<br>
        All four bands place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores in addition to the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.<br><br>
        
        Songs are often highly atmospheric, though more upbeat than those of other metal subgenres; even songs with morbid themes routinely feature prominent major-key fanfares. Particularly central to creating mood and atmosphere is the choice of keyboard sounds.
        Lyrics cover a broad range of topics. As with two of symphonic metal's otherwise most dissimilar influences, power metal and opera (but also symphonic progressive rock),<br>
        fantasy and mythological themes are common. Concept albums styled after operas or epic poems are not uncommon.<br>
        Bands in this genre often feature a female lead vocalist, most commonly a soprano. There is sometimes a second, male vocalist, as is also common in gothic metal.<br>
        Growling, death-metal-style vocals are not unknown, but tend to be used less frequently than in other metal genres that make use of this vocal style<br>
        (however, a notable example of its usage is by Mark Jansen in Epica). Further backup up to and including a full choir is sometimes employed.<br><br>

        It is very common for bands, almost exclusively female-fronted bands, to feature operatic lead vocals.<br>
        The term "symphonic metal" is used to denote any metal band that makes use of symphonic or orchestral elements; "symphonic metal" then is not so much a genre as a cross-generic designation.<br>
        A few bands refer to themselves as "symphonic metal," particularly Aesma Daeva, and the term could probably be applied to generically ambiguous metal bands like Epica and Nightwish.<br><br>

    Bands: Epica, Nightwish, Therion, Kamelot, Within Temptation, Rhapsody. </h2><br>
