    <h1> _ GOTHIC METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock.<br>
        The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music.<br>
        The genre originated during the early 1990s in the United Kingdom originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal.<br>
        Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences and sometimes<br>
        they are known to be melodramatic, fantasized, romantic, dark or sometimes gloomy.<br>
        The settings depicted by the lyrics are most often in the New Age or the Dark Ages, but can also be in Victorian, Edwardian, Roman, or modern eras.<br>
        The romantic and fantasy themed lyrics often used in gothic metal cover many broad subjects and are intended as being themes and guides to the lyricist,<br>
        rather than a complete prerequisite of the genre.
        Gothic metal bands normally have two vocalists, (also known as "Beauty and the Beast" vocals) but are not limited to this style.<br>
        One vocalist is typically male and uses vocals akin to black or death metal. The other vocalist is usually female, and often uses soprano vocals, or harmonic singing.<br>
        Sometimes bands will use other forms of vocals included with the two prior vocalists, including (but not limited to) female death/black vocals, choirs,<br>
        Gregorian chanting and male singing, but this tends to be limited to backing vocals and their thematic use within the song.<br><br>
        
        In the 21st century, gothic metal has moved towards the mainstream in Europe, particularly in Finland where groups such as Entwine,<br>
        HIM, Lullacry and Poisonblack have released hit singles or chart-topping albums.<br>
        In the US, however, only a few bands such as Type O Negative & Evanescence have found some degree of commercial success.<br><br>

    Bands: Type O Negative, Paradise Lost, HIM, Moonspell, Draconian, Tristania. </h2><br>
