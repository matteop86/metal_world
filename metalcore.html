    <h1> _ METALCORE _ </h1><br>
    <h2> Metalcore (or metallic hardcore) is a fusion music genre that combines elements of extreme metal and hardcore punk since mid-1980s in USA.<br>
    As with other styles blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, slow, intense passages conducive to moshing.<br>
    Other defining instrumentation includes heavy guitar riffs, occasional blast beats, and double bass drumming.<br>
    Vocalists in the genre typically yell or scream. Some later metalcore bands combine this with clean singing, often during the chorus.
    The genre was more popular in the early 1990s and expanded in the midâ€“late 1990s and still growing strong from 2000 onward.<br><br>
         
    Today, metalcore is still one of the most popular genres of metal, even with criticism from some in the underground metal community.<br>
    The genre has also spawned numerous offshoots and subgenres such as deathcore, electronicore, mathcore, and others.<br><br>
