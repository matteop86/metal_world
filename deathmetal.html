    <h1> _ DEATH METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars,<br>
        played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick and blast beat techniques,<br>
        minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes, and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence,<br>
        political conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, and science fiction.
        While in USA especially bands from Florida and New York gathered influence and also were simultaneously technical sophisticated.<br>
        Later at the end of the 80's Death Metal grow more and more in Europe especially in Sweden with bands like Unleashed, Entombed or Grave. The musical style of Death Metal goes from slow,<br>
        rolling riffs to high speed riffs. The guitar tunes are most often dropped on one note, frequently on two or more, also considered remarkable are also the sudden tempo and rhytm switches.<br>
        Death metal is considered an "underground" form of music, and has been met with considerable hostility from mainstream culture, mainly because of the socially unattractive themes,<br>
        imagery and stage personae surrounding many bands.<br><br>
        
        In the 1990s, Death Metal really started to expand and grow bigger as more and more bands formed under new sub genres that just kept on coming,<br>
        getting noticeably more intricate and confusing as you go.<br><br>

    Bands: Possessed, Death, Cannibal Corpse, Obituary, Morbid Angel.</h2><br>
