    <h1> _ SPEED METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots.<br>
        It is described by AllMusic as "extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding" music.<br>

        "It is usually considered less abrasive and more melodic than thrash metal, showing less influence from hardcore punk.<br>
        However, speed metal is usually faster and more aggressive than traditional heavy metal, also showing more inclination to virtuoso soloing and featuring<br>
        short instrumental passages between couplets.<br>
        Speed metal songs frequently make use of highly expressive vocals, but are usually less likely to employ 'harsh' vocals than thrash metal songs."<br>
        the genre was aptly named "Speed King" by Deep Purple. Recording on the song started in 1969 making it nearly a full decade ahead of the musical style being recognized.<br>
        The song is not only very fast and technical but was also extremely loud creating noticeable distortion in the recording process.<br>
        The title song for the band's next album, "Fireball", is a further refinement of the band's influence with drummer Ian Paice's use of the double bass.<br>
        The way the double bass is played in "Fireball"—uptempo "four on the floor"—becomes a mainstay in many Heavy, Speed and Thrash Metal songs in the years to come.<br>
        A German heavy metal band called Accept played an important role in the development of speed and thrash metal, being part of the German heavy metal scene, which emerged in the early to mid-1980s.<br>
        Of particular importance was their 1982 track "Fast as a Shark".<br><br>

        Speed metal's sound varied between various regional scenes. European bands leaned towards the sound of bands like Venom and Motörhead. Japanese bands had a more melodic sound that resembled power metal.<br>
        North American bands had a faster, more aggressive sound that would later influence the thrash metal movement.<br>
        The genre has had a notable merger with black metal to create a blackened speed metal sound,<br>
        typically consisting of speed metal guitar riffs with black metal vocals styles and an altogether dirtier atmosphere compared to straight speed metal bands or other hybrid styles,<br>
        taking their cues from the early template laid down by Venom.<br>
        On MMA, speed/thrash and speed/power metal releases will typically be placed under thrash and power metal respectively, while speed/heavy releases will be placed under speed metal.<br>
        Blackened speed metal will usually be included under speed metal with the work of neoclassical based artists will be included under neoclassical metal.<br><br>
