    <h1> _ GLAM METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Glam metal, also known as hair metal or pop metal, is a subgenre of heavy metal, which features pop-influenced hooks and guitar riffs, and borrows heavily from the fashion and image of 1970s glam rock.<br>
        Early glam metal evolved directly from the glam rock movement of the 1970s, as visual elements taken from acts such as T. Rex, the New York Dolls, and David Bowie (and to a lesser extent,<br>
        the punk and new wave movements taking place concurrently in New York City) were fused with the decidedly more heavy metal leaning and theatrical acts<br>
        The first examples of this fusion began appearing in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, particularly on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene,<br>
        Did achieve huge commercial success from approximately 1981 to 1991 and from a strictly visual perspective, glam metal is defined by flashy and tight-fitting clothing,<br>
        makeup, and an overall androgynous aesthetic in which the traditional "denim & leather" aspect of heavy metal culture is replaced by spandex, lace, and heavy use of the color pink.<br>
        Glam metal suffered a decline in popularity in the early-mid 1990s, as the grunge and alternative phenomena revolutionized hard rock,<br>
        and fans' tastes moved toward a more natural and stripped-down aesthetic and a rejection of the glam metal visual style.<br>
        Although very popular in the eighties, to the genre came under increasing negative attention because of the lavish lifestyle of the band members.<br>
        Despite the lasting negative impression on the general public hair metal has failed, there are still young people and new bands with an interest in this kind of heavy metal.<br>
        This is possible due to the fact that the rest of the genre since black metal through death metal, thrash metal, metalcore and ultimately getting harder and has become more extreme.<br>
        This is a vacuum in which people are searching for hard music but less harsh than the rest of what metal has to offer.<br>
        Some older glam metal bands have performed here is handy and from 2000 on in style and often also in the occupation of during the 1980s.<br><br>
