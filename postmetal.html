    <h1> _ POST METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Post-metal is a style of music that is rooted in heavy metal but explores approaches beyond the genre's conventions.<br>
        It emerged in the 1990s through the work of bands such as Neurosis and Godflesh who transformed metal texture through experimental composition.<br>
        Associated with and inspired by post-rock and post-hardcore, the genre employs the darkness and intensity of extreme metal but<br>
        emphasizes atmosphere, emotion, and even "revelation", drawing on a wide range of sources including ambient, noise, psychedelic, progressive, and classical music to develop an expansive but introspective sound.<br>
        Post-metal songs are typically long, with loose and layered structures that discard the verseâ€“chorus form in favor of crescendos and repeating themes.<br>
        The sound centres on guitars and drums; any vocals are usually screamed or growled and resemble an additional instrument.<br><br>

        Post-metal is generally heavy, aggressive, and dark, but explores a variety of musical approaches alien to conventional heavy metal and extreme metal.<br>
        It mirrors post-rock and post-hardcore in its emphasis on atmosphere and deep emotion and may be considered abstract, introspective, expansive, hypnotic, progressive, layered, or even apocalyptic.<br>
        Jon Wiederhorn writes that though some post-metal bands "sought to break away from their raging roots by exploring less bombastic and more dynamic musical techniques" and others "sought to remain raw and corrosive",<br>
        their music shares a "heavy-lidded yet eye-opening" effect. The New York Times associated the term with a "wave of bands using metal as a jumping-off point for a range of experimental styles,<br>
        dabbling in free jazz, minimalist post-rock, noise and even modern classical music."<br>
        Contemporary post-metal bands incorporate influences ranging through doom metal, black metal, shoegazing, progressive rock, folk music, and classical music.<br><br>

        The term post-rock was coined in 1994 and soon used to describe a diverse group of bands that shared "a penchant for drifting melodies and the desire to expand beyond established rock boundaries".<br>
        As this movement swelled, bands from post-hardcore and experimental backgrounds began to incorporate its tendencies of "ambience, offbeat experimentation, downcast melodies and psychedelia" into metal.<br>
        The two genres further converged through the influence of post-rock bands such as Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Lift to Experience who shared metal's emphasis on loudness.<br><br>
