    <h1> _ CHRISTIAN METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Christian metal, also known as white metal, Jesus metal or heavenly metal, is a form of heavy metal music usually defined by its message<br>
        using song lyrics as well as the dedication of the band members to Christianity. Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians<br>
        principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and often produced and distributed through various Christian networks.<br>
        
        Christian metal bands exist in most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, the only common link between most Christian metal bands are the lyrics,<br>
        and often the Christian themes are melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter.<br>
        Christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelization to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by the American Resurrection Band and Barnabas,<br>
        the Swedish Jerusalem, and Canadian Daniel Band. Los Angeles' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s.<br>
        In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as Vengeance Rising, Deliverance, Believer and Tourniquet.<br>
        In the early 1990s, the Australian death metal band Mortification rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene.<br>
        At the turn of the 21st century, the nu metal band P.O.D, with two platinum-selling albums, achieved a mainstream commercial success rivaling that of Stryper.<br>
        The metalcore groups Underoath, Demon Hunter, As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean (dubbed "The Holy Alliance" by Revolver Magazine) also brought some mainstream attention<br>
        to the movement in the first decade of the 2000s, achieving ranks in the Billboard 200.<br><br>
