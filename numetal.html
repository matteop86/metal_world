    <h1> _ NU METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Nu metal (sometimes stylized as n√º-metal) is a subgenre of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop,<br>
        alternative rock, funk, industrial, and grunge. Nu metal bands have drawn elements and influences from a variety of musical styles, including multiple genres of heavy metal.<br>
        Nu metal rarely features guitar solos or other displays of technical competence; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs.<br>
        Many nu metal guitarists use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to play a heavier sound. DJs are occasionally featured in nu metal to provide instrumentation such as sampling,<br>
        turntable scratching and electronic backgrounds. Vocal styles in nu metal include singing, rapping, screaming and growling.<br>
        Nu metal is one of the key genres of the new wave of American heavy metal and became popular in the late 1990s but slowly declining in the middle 2000s.<br>
        During the 2010s, there was a nu metal revival; many bands that combine nu metal with other genres (for example, metalcore and deathcore) emerged<br>
        and some nu metal bands from the 1990s and early 2000s returned to the nu metal sound.<br>
        Nu metal emerged during a period when metal had been cast out of the mainstream. Replaced by grunge, metal began developing new styles away from the limelight and nu metal<br>
        was one of the most commercially viable to appear during that time. Unlike their peers in the grunge music scene, nu metal bands had no problem embracing the mainstream,<br>
        in fact, many nu metal bands appeared to have formed precisely with the goal of gaining fame and glory.<br>
        Though the nu metal hay-day is considered over by some, many of the bands continue to release new material and tour the globe.<br>
        Although attendance at shows has dropped for many, bands like Korn are still able to pull large crowds.<br><br>

    Bands: Linkin Park, Korn, Limp Bizkit, System Of A Down, Slipknot, Papa Roach. </h2><br>
