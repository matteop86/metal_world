    <h1> _ FOLK METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s.<br>
        It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles<br>
        (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.<br>
        The earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England and Cruachan from Ireland. Skyclad's debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth<br>
        was released in 1991 and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachanâ€™s early work which embraced the folk element<br>
        as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond.<br>
        Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal.<br>
        Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence,<br>
        particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.<br><br>

        The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music.<br>
        A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line-ups.<br>
        The music of folk metal is a diverse collection with bands pursuing different subgenres of heavy metal music.<br>
        The genre also offers a variety of atmosphere and moods. A fun and cheerful nature is characteristic of groups also noted for playing music that one can dance to.<br>
        The large number of instruments that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances.<br>
        Popular subjects in folk metal include paganism, nature, fantasy, mythology and history<br><br>
