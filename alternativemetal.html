    <h1> _ ALTERNATIVE METAL _ </h1><br>
    <h2>Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music fusion genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres<br>
        not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs,<br>
        a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles.<br>
        The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s.<br>
        The genre is generally considered a fusion between alternative rock and heavy metal, although Allmusic states "alt-metal is a far-reaching term that<br>
        has been used to describe everyone from Hammerlock to Neurosis to Ministry to Limp Bizkit". They also remarked that alternative metal was originally<br>
        "a style united by its nonconformist sensibility rather than any immediately classifiable sound.<br>
        The origins of the genre can be traced back to funk rock music of the early to mid-1980s and in the latter part of the 1990s, a second, more aggressive wave<br>
        of alternative metal emerged; dubbed nu metal, it often relied on hardcore punk, groove/thrash metal, industrial and hip hop influences,<br>
        as opposed to the influences of the first wave of alternative metal bands, with this style subsequently becoming more popular than regular alternative metal.<br><br>

        A number of bands from the nu metal era — such as System of a Down, Godsmack, Karnivool and Deftones — are still primarily classed as alternative metal,<br>
        due to lacking specific elements associated with the nu metal genre. In 2016, Jason Heller of Vice wrote "The term alternative metal still pops up from time to time,<br>
        but it’s no more relevant or meaningful today than alternative rock. Instead, it’s a relic. But the brief,<br>
        nebulous era of alternative metal in the late 80s and early 90s remains a snapshot of a vibrant time when a brash new generation of heavy-leaning bands threw everything against the wall to see what stuck.<br><br>
